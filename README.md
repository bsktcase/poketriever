Greetings! This was a fun project; I learned a lot about writing ugly-but-functional JavaScript, and I got pretty familiar with the Google Sheets API which is handy.

Sadly, Niantic finally permanently closed the backdoors into their Pokémon GO APIs in ~2018, so the core components of the app no longer work and this repo is no longer being maintained.

Yes, people still play Pokémon GO.
